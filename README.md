In Machine Learning and AI with Python, I have explored the most basic algorithm as a basis form learning and understanding of machine learning: decision trees. Developing core skills in machine learning which create the foundation for expanding knowledge into bagging and random forests, and from there into more complex algorithms like gradient boosting. Using real-world cases and sample data sets, I have examined processes, chart expectations, review the results, and measure the effectiveness of the machine’s techniques. Throughout the course,  witness the evolution of the machine learning models, incorporating additional data and criteria – testing the predictions and analyzing the results along the way to avoid overtraining data, mitigating overfitting and preventing biased outcomes.
